### Description

NVS Invoice is a small accounting app that creates invoices for small businesses. I'm creating this application because my father created a software similar to this but since he is getting older he can no longer manage his own application. I want to create the same application to make invoicing not a chore for my mother's business.

### Technologies

- NextJS
- Typescript
- Firebase
